deep understanding in C++ about how things really implement.

c-front is a compiler software to convert .cpp project to c languge.

#### This project doing c-fron's work.
Take a .cpp file code and convert to .c equelivent code (assuming it compiled well in c++).                                    
including encapsulation, private functions, nameing functions, const static and global variables and functions, default values.                                          
inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions - virtual tables.
